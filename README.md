# Game AI Library
Library for implementing agents for playing games

## Goals 
The library should allow:
- Quickly build a simple bot for online game competition.
- Use of different algorithms from simple tree search to machine learning.
- Be fast to be used for real game rather than only for prototyping.


## Code structure

This code in the repository is structured in the following way:

```
src/              <--- All source code is located here
  core/           <--- Core classes used across different games
  algorithms/     <--- Algorithms used accross different games
  games/          <--- Implementations of games simulators and players
  tests/          <--- Tests for all code
  third_party/    <--- All 3rd-party code
  scripts/        <--- Helper scripts
```
